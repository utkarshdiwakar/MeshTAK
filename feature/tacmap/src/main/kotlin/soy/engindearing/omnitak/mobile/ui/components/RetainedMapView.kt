/**
 * #177 — process-lifetime holder for the single MapLibre [MapView].
 *
 * The map composable used to create its [MapView] in a plain `remember {}`, so
 * any time the map destination left composition (notably navigating to a
 * full-screen destination like Settings) the view was disposed and
 * `onDestroy()`-ed, forcing a cold MapLibre re-initialisation — a multi-second
 * reload — on return. (Map↔Chat felt instant because those toggles kept the GL
 * context / tile cache warm; a heavier Settings detour evicted it.)
 *
 * Retaining the one native MapView across compositions keeps the engine, style,
 * tiles and camera alive so returning to the map is instant. The view is only
 * truly torn down when the process goes away.
 *
 * Because the retained MapView's one-time gesture/idle listeners are registered
 * once (at first creation) but the map composable is recreated on every return,
 * those listeners must NOT capture composition-scoped `rememberUpdatedState`
 * holders — those stop updating once their composition is disposed, which would
 * leave map taps wired to a dead composition. Instead the listeners read live
 * callbacks/state from [bindings], a stable holder the composable refreshes on
 * every recomposition.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: a single Android View can have at most one parent. The map
 * composable must [detach] the view from its old parent before the `AndroidView`
 * re-attaches it, otherwise Compose throws "The specified child already has a
 * parent."
 *
 * Not thread-safe by design — only touched from the main thread (composition).
