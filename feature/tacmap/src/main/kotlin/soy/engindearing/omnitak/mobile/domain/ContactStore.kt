/**
 * Application-scoped roster of last-known CoT contacts keyed by UID.
 * Updates are diff-friendly — the underlying StateFlow re-emits only
 * when a referentially-new map is assigned, and the GeoJson layer on
 * the map rebuilds features from whatever is latest here.
 *
 * Writers are concurrent (per-server collectors on Dispatchers.Default,
 * the Meshtastic cotSink, gyb + Remote ID pipelines on appScope), so
 * every read-modify-write goes through [MutableStateFlow.update]'s CAS
 * loop — a plain `value = value + x` can silently drop a concurrent
 * ingest under multi-server CoT burst.
